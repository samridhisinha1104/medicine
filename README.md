This project bridges machine learning with intuitive web technologies to provide a responsive medicine recommendation system. It integrates frontend design, Python backend logic, and real-world datasets to deliver accurate, user-friendly results.
 Features
-  Symptom-to-Medicine Matching: Suggests relevant medicines based on user-provided symptoms.
-  Interactive Web Interface: Clean and responsive UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-  Flask Backend Integration: Robust routing and logic handling via Python-Flask framework.
-  Error Handling: Catch and resolve user input errors, missing values, and dataset inconsistencies.
-  Dataset Processing: Normalization and transformation of healthcare datasets using Pandas in Jupyter.
